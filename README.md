PageFoundry — Ormond Beach Landing

What this is
- A clean, coastal‑inspired one‑pager tailored for PageFoundry and Ormond Beach, FL.

How to customize
- Update copy in `index.html`: hero H1, services, niches, and contact mailto.
- Colors live in `styles.css`: `--sea` (teal) and `--sky` (blue) control the brand gradient.

Deploy (Vercel — free)
1) Create a new project → Import this folder → Framework: Other → Build command: none → Output: this folder.
2) After deploy, add your custom domain `pagefoundry.dev` and point DNS to Vercel (CNAME for `www`, ALIAS/A for root).
3) Optionally 301 redirect root to `www` in Vercel settings.

SEO
- Update `<title>` and meta description in the `<head>`.
- Add Open Graph image if you’d like (static image under `/assets/og.png`).
