              <h2>My Story</h2>
              <p class="story-lead">In 2022, I bought my first home in Ormond Beach after moving from Columbus, Ohio. I came here to raise my family around the people I care about—and I quickly fell in love with this community.</p>
              
              <p>What I noticed was that many amazing local businesses had websites that didn't do them justice. Or worse, no website at all. In today's world, most people check reviews and browse online before visiting a business. If they can't find you, they might shop somewhere else entirely.</p>
              
              <p>That's when I realized I could use my professional skills to help. I've spent years building complex systems for Fortune 500 companies, high-growth startups, and cybersecurity firms. Now I want to use that expertise to help everyday businesses in the community I've chosen to call home.</p>
