# Green Coast Realty — Ormond Beach, FL

A focused, conversion‑oriented landing page for a local Realtor. Distinct design (deep green + gold), fast, accessible, and deployable as a static site.

## How to edit
- Colors: update CSS variables in `styles.css`:
  - `--green` (primary), `--gold` (accent), `--bg` (background)
- Copy & CTAs: edit `index.html`.
  - Buttons link to `tel:+1-386-555-0123` and `mailto:owner@example.com`.
- Featured listings: update the three sample cards in `#listings` or remove the section.
- Neighborhoods: adjust the pills under `#neighborhoods`.
- Hours/Address/Map: edit `#hours`. The map is a styled placeholder div; replace with a static image if you have one (keep descriptive `aria-label` or `alt`).

## Suggested tweaks for this niche
- Replace images in `assets/` with your own or curated stock (Unsplash, Pexels, or your photography). Keep file names and dimensions for a quick swap.
- Add a short "What to expect" timeline (consult → tours → offer → close).
- Include brokerage disclosure/MLS compliance notes if needed.
- Swap testimonials for 2–3 anonymized review snippets.
- If you have a Calendly or booking email, swap the secondary CTA to that.

## Example SEO
- Title: `Green Coast Realty — Ormond Beach, FL | Buy & Sell Homes`
